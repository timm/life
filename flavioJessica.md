F: LN aggregates a very large number of sources. gov agencies (e.g. motor vehciles, crimal data) and commercial entities (utilities and phone records) etc. linked it all, even if there are no unique identifiers (e.g. reverse frequecny of similar tokens). Comparies are top Fortune 100 companies and top 50 companies. Use the data to do certain portions of their work (e.g. indeitfy management (we call in, lost account, what questions to ask), credit worthiness, fraud detection). So mostly coporoate customers (usually not end users-- except under circumstances like witness protection program). Sometimes individual clients (e.g. law enforecment tracking criminals).

F: some laws effect what is delivered. e.g. SSN might need to be masked before deliverable depending on the purposes.
